The history of the Patio tech coop federation

In 2021, a group of coop members came together on a Mattermost instance to chat and get to know one-another. Inspired by the FACTTIC coop federation in Argentina, the group had a dream of building a global tech coop federation.

In 2021 and 2022, the group came together for several "parties" where the group played games, had fun, and chatted about lots of things.

In 2022, the group consented to the name "Patio," having been an un-named group for a while.

Also in 2022, Patio consented to the creation of a landing page. Work was done with design and content, and now (2022-07-01) work has begun on the technical implementation of the site.

We are excited to see where Patio goes from here.
